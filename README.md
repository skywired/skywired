Hi, I’m Jess (@skywired) - it's nice to meet you!

I'm pursing a post-bacc in computer science while working full time as a project manager.

I graduated with a B.S. in Nanoengineering and worked as a researcher.
While I'm thankful for my experiences working on product development in the context of biotech, I'm excited to explore this in the context of consumer technology!

Right now, I am primarily interested in UX/UI and web development.
