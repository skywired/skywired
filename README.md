Hi, I’m Jess (@skywired) - it's nice to meet you!

I'm pursing a post-bacc in computer science while working full time as a project manager.

I graduated with a B.S. Nanoengineering and worked as a researcher for a few years.
While I'm thankful for my experiences in biotech and pharma, I'm excited to explore a different path.

I'm still relatively new to all of this, but I am primarily interested in UX/UI, and web development.
